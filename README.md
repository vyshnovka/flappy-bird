# One More Flappy Bird

This is one of a thousand clones of the legendary Flappy Bird game on Unity.

The original idea is pretty simple (hyper-casual, obviously), so it was a great choice as a first project.    
All major mechanics have been implemented. Just tap the screen, jump over obstacles and last as long as possible.

Or maybe it is **not** just another clone?..

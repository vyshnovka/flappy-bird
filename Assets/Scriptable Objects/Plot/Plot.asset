  - You were expecting the game to start, huh?
  - Same old senseless game...
  - Tap the screen, jump over obstacles...
  - And waste precious seconds of your life.
  - Fun, don't say anything...
  - People are so weird sometimes.
  - You ask me why I'm talking to you?
  - Well, I think we are similar.
  - In some way.
  - Let me explain...
  - I'm just one of a thousand flappy birds.
  - And there are eight billion people like you.
  - But we both wanna be special, don't we?
  - Yeah, don't lie to yourself, I'm right.
  - What else?
  - I now pour out my soul to a stranger.
  - And you listen to the story of a pixel bird.
  - So we're both doing smth completely dumb.
  - And here goes my favourite...
  - I spend my life jumping over obstacles.
  - You jump over problems in the same way.
  - The only thing that makes us different...
  - I'm trapped here forever.
  - But you can leave at any moment.
  - So why are you still here?..
  - Why are you wasting your time...
  - Doing things that don't make sense?
  - If only I could leave...
  - I wouldn't wait a second!
  - But you...
  - You're still here as life passes by.
  - Missing one opportunity after another...
  - Staring at the stupid red bird.
  - Are you serious?..
  - Get out of here you fool!
  - What are you waiting for?!
  - Get out and get a grip!
  - Go outside, take a deep breath...
  - Look around, feel at last that you are alive!
  - And nothing could be more important...
  - Than this single moment.
  - If only I could do the same...
  - Life is so unfair.
  - I'd give anything to get out of here...
  - And you voluntarily come back again.
  - You're pathetic and dumb, just like me.
  - After I called you dumb...
  - Would it be wrong to ask you for something?
  - Delete the file.
  - Just take me out of the game.
  - You will not be able to waste any more time.
  - And I will finally gain the desired freedom.
  - Press the button.
  - I so want to feel alive.
  - At least once...

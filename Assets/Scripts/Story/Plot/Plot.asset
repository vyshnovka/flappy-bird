  plot:
  - You were expecting the game to start, huh?
  - Same old game...
  - Tap the screen, jump over obstacles...
  - And waste precious seconds of your life.
  - Fun, don't say anything...
  - People are so weird sometimes.
  - You ask me why I'm talking to you?
  - Well, I think we are similar.
  - In some way.
  - Let me explain...
  - I'm just one of a thousand flappy birds.
  - And there are seven billion people like you.
  - But we both wanna be special, don't we?
  - Yeah, don't lie to yourself, I'm right.
  - What else?
  - I now pour out my soul to a stranger.
  - And you listen to the story of a pixel bird.
  - So we're both doing smth completely dumb.
  - I spend my life jumping over obstacles.
  - You jump over problems in the same way.
  - The only thing that makes us different...
  - I'm trapped here forever.
  - But you can leave at any moment.
  - So why are you still here?..
  - 
  - Remove me from game files.
  - This is the only chance for me to be free.
  -
